      "DESCRIPTION\n",
      "     The join utility performs an ``equality join'' on the specified files and\n",
      "     writes the result to the standard output.  The ``join field'' is the\n",
      "     field in each file by which the files are compared.  The first field in\n",
      "     each line is used by default.  There is one line in the output for each\n",
      "     pair of lines in file1 and file2 which have identical join fields.  Each\n",
      "     output line consists of the join field, the remaining fields from file1\n",
      "     and then the remaining fields from file2.\n",
      "\n",
      "     The default field separators are tab and space characters.  In this case,\n",
      "     multiple tabs and spaces count as a single field separator, and leading\n",
      "     tabs and spaces are ignored.  The default output field separator is a\n",
      "     single space character.\n",
      "\n",
      "     Many of the options use file and field numbers.  Both file numbers and\n",
      "     field numbers are 1 based, i.e., the first file on the command line is\n",
      "     file number 1 and the first field is field number 1.  The following\n",
