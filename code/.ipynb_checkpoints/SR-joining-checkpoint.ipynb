      "\n",
      "NAME\n",
      "     cut -- cut out selected portions of each line of a file\n",
      "\n",
      "SYNOPSIS\n",
      "     cut -b list [-n] [file ...]\n",
      "     cut -c list [file ...]\n",
      "     cut -f list [-d delim] [-s] [file ...]\n",
      "\n",
      "DESCRIPTION\n",
      "     The cut utility cuts out selected portions of each line (as specified by\n",
      "     list) from each file and writes them to the standard output.  If no file\n",
      "     arguments are specified, or a file argument is a single dash (`-'), cut\n",
      "     reads from the standard input.  The items specified by list can be in\n",
      "     terms of column position or in terms of fields delimited by a special\n",
      "     character.  Column numbering starts from 1.\n",
      "\n",
      "     The list option argument is a comma or whitespace separated set of num-\n",
      "     bers and/or number ranges.  Number ranges consist of a number, a dash\n",
      "     (`-'), and a second number and select the fields or columns from the\n",
      "     first number to the second, inclusive.  Numbers or number ranges may be\n",
      "     preceded by a dash, which selects all fields or columns from 1 to the\n",
      "     last number.  Numbers or number ranges may be followed by a dash, which\n",
      "     selects all fields or columns from the last number to the end of the\n",
      "     line.  Numbers and number ranges may be repeated, overlapping, and in any\n",
      "     order.  If a field or column is specified multiple times, it will appear\n",
      "     only once in the output.  It is not an error to select fields or columns\n",
      "     not present in the input line.\n",
      "\n",
      "     The options are as follows:\n",
      "\n",

      "     -d delim\n",
      "             Use delim as the field delimiter character instead of the tab\n",

      "\n",

      "             The list specifies fields, separated in the input by the field\n",
      "             delimiter character (see the -d option.)  Output fields are sepa-\n",
      "             rated by a single occurrence of the field delimiter character.\n",
      "\n",
      "     -n      Do not split multi-byte characters.  Characters will only be out-\n",
      "             put if at least one byte is selected, and, after a prefix of zero\n",
      "             or more unselected bytes, the rest of the bytes that form the\n",
      "             character are selected.\n",
      "\n",
      "     -s      Suppress lines with no field delimiter characters.  Unless speci-\n",
      "             fied, lines with no delimiters are passed through unmodified.\n",
      "\n",
      "ENVIRONMENT\n",
      "     The LANG, LC_ALL and LC_CTYPE environment variables affect the execution\n",
      "     of cut as described in environ(7).\n",
      "\n",
      "EXIT STATUS\n",
      "     The cut utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.\n",
      "\n",
      "EXAMPLES\n",
